## Introduction to Databases

A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Databases are used to store various types of data, from small amounts like a contact list in a phone to large amounts like the entire inventory of a global company. 

There are various types of databases, but the most commonly used are:

- **Relational databases** (RDBMS): These databases use tables to store data. The schema of a relational database is defined and fixed before data is stored in it. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database.

- **NoSQL databases**: These databases store data in non-tabular form, and they're often used for big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL databases can store data as key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph stores, or document stores. MongoDB is an example of a NoSQL database.

Databases help maintain data integrity, consistency, and security. They also provide useful features like data backup and recovery, support for queries, and simultaneous access by multiple users.

## Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting, thus enabling the development of fast and scalable network applications.

Key features of Node.js include:

- **Event-driven and non-blocking I/O model**: This makes Node.js lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

- **Single-threaded**: While single-threaded, Node.js uses asynchronous function calls to maintain concurrency, keeping performance high without the need for multi-threading.

- **Package management with NPM**: Node.js comes with the node package manager (NPM) which allows developers to install, share, and manage software packages in their applications.

- **Support for Modern JavaScript**: Node.js supports ES6/ES2015 syntax and features, providing developers with the ability to write modern and readable JavaScript code.

In the context of working with databases, Node.js can be used to build server-side applications that require data persistence, thus requiring interaction with databases.

Databases are a crucial aspect of any application development, including those developed using Node.js. Their importance stems from the need to store, retrieve, update, and delete data (CRUD operations), which are common operations in virtually all kinds of applications.

Here are some of the key reasons why databases are important in Node.js applications:

**1. Data Persistence:** Databases provide a means for data to be persistently stored and accessed. When you're running an application that needs to store user data, product information, transactions, etc., this data needs to remain available, even beyond the lifecycle of the application. That's where databases come in.

**2. Efficient Data Access:** Databases are designed for efficient data access and manipulation. They offer advanced techniques and features like indexing, query optimization, and caching, which speed up data access. This is important for Node.js applications, as it allows them to provide a faster and better user experience.

**3. Data Security:** Databases offer features to ensure data security, such as access control, data encryption, and backup mechanisms. These features are important in Node.js applications to prevent unauthorized access to data, keep sensitive data encrypted, and prevent data loss.

**4. Data Consistency:** Databases provide mechanisms to ensure data consistency, meaning that data remains accurate and consistent across all access points, regardless of the number of operations performed on the data.

**5. Handling Concurrent Users:** Databases are designed to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently, ensuring that many users can interact with the application and its data at the same time. This is crucial for Node.js applications that are expected to support multiple users concurrently.

**6. Scalability:** As Node.js applications grow, so does the data associated with them. Databases are designed to handle such growth, providing mechanisms to scale horizontally (by distributing data across multiple servers) or vertically (by adding more power to the current server). This is essential to ensure that the growth of the application does not affect its performance or availability.

In conclusion, databases are an essential part of Node.js applications, providing a means to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage the data that these applications need to function effectively and provide a quality user experience.

Node.js interacts with databases using packages or libraries, typically provided via the Node Package Manager (NPM). These libraries provide an API that allows Node.js applications to connect to a database, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Depending on the database and the library used, Node.js can interact with the database using either SQL (for relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL) or a database-specific query language (like MongoDB's query language).

Here's a general overview of how this interaction works:

**1. Installing the Database Library:** The first step in interacting with a database in Node.js is to install the relevant library. This is typically done using NPM. For example, if you're using MySQL, you might use the `mysql` library. If you're using MongoDB, you might use the `mongodb` library, or a library like `mongoose` that provides an additional layer of features.

**2. Establishing a Connection:** Once the library is installed, you use it to establish a connection with your database. This typically involves providing the URL of your database server, and any necessary authentication information. In most applications, you'll maintain this connection for the lifetime of the application, or use a connection pool to manage multiple connections and reuse them for multiple operations.

**3. Executing Queries:** Once the connection is established, you can use it to execute queries against your database. These might be SQL queries (for MySQL or PostgreSQL), or they might use a different query format (for MongoDB). Your queries will depend on the structure of your database and the specific data you want to access or manipulate.

**4. Processing Results:** After executing a query, the database will return some results. These might be the rows of a table (for a `SELECT` query in SQL), or a confirmation of the operation (for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` queries). The database library will usually provide these results in a format that's easy to use in JavaScript, such as an array of objects.

**5. Handling Errors:** During any of these steps, errors can occur. For example, the database connection might fail, or a query might be incorrectly formatted. These errors need to be handled in your code to ensure that your application can recover gracefully.

That's a general overview of how Node.js interacts with databases. The specifics will depend on the exact database and library you're using, but this should give you a good starting point.

## Introduction to MySQL

MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL), which is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.

MySQL is used by many web-based applications to store data. It is preferred for its speed, reliability, ease of use, and robustness. Its popularity is also due to its compatibility with various platforms and its support for numerous programming languages, including Node.js.

## Setting up a MySQL Database for Use in Node.js

Here are the steps to set up a MySQL database for use in Node.js.

**Step 1: Install MySQL**

First, you need to install MySQL on your computer. The installation process varies depending on your operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac). You can download MySQL from the official MySQL website and follow their installation guide.

**Step 2: Install Node.js**

Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website. You should also have npm (node package manager), which comes bundled with Node.js installation.

To check all tables in a MySQL database using the MySQL Command-Line Interface (CLI), follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal application on your macOS.

2. Start the MySQL CLI by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

   ```
   mysql -u your_username -p
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your MySQL username. Enter your MySQL password when prompted.

3. After entering the password, you should be inside the MySQL CLI.

4. Switch to the desired database using the `USE` statement:

   ```
   USE your_database_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name` with the name of the database you want to check the tables for.

5. To view all tables in the current database, you can use the following command:

   ```
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

   This command will list all the tables present in the selected database.

If you want to check a specific table's structure or information, you can use the `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements. Here's how:

1. Make sure you're already inside the MySQL CLI and connected to the desired database.

2. To view the structure of a specific table, use the `DESCRIBE` statement followed by the table name:

   ```
   DESCRIBE your_table_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_table_name` with the name of the table you want to check.

   This command will display the column names, data types, and other details of the specified table.

3. To view the complete create statement for a specific table, you can use the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement:

   ```
   SHOW CREATE TABLE your_table_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_table_name` with the name of the table you want to check.

   This command will show the complete SQL statement used to create the specified table, including all the columns, indexes, and constraints.

By using these commands, you can check all tables in a MySQL database or inspect specific tables in detail using the MySQL CLI on macOS.

### ERRORS: 

- `Error occurred on connection of db: Error: ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE: Client does not support authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading MySQL client`

Solution,

`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'helloworld123'`

**Step 3: Create a New Node.js Application**

Create a new folder on your computer and initialize a new Node.js application there by running `npm init -y`. This will create a new `package.json` file in your directory.

**Step 4: Install MySQL Node.js Driver**

You will need the MySQL Node.js driver to enable interaction between MySQL and your Node.js application. Install it using npm by running the command: `npm install mysql`.

**Step 5: Setting Up Connection**

Create a new file in your application directory, e.g., `db.js`. In this file, you will set up the connection to your MySQL database.

Here is a simple example of how to set up a connection:

```javascript
var mysql      = require('mysql');
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host     : 'localhost',
  user     : 'your-username',
  password : 'your-password',
  database : 'your-database'
});

connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error('error connecting: ' + err.stack);
    return;
  }

  console.log('connected as id ' + connection.threadId);
});

module.exports = connection;
```

Replace `'localhost'`, `'your-username'`, `'your-password'`, and `'your-database'` with your actual MySQL server details.

You have now set up a MySQL database for use in Node.js. You can import `db.js` in your other files to use the `connection` object to interact with your MySQL database. Remember, each interaction should handle potential errors and should close the connection when it's no longer needed.

Sure, let's go through some common SQL queries and their uses. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing data in relational databases. It's a powerful tool with many capabilities.

1. **SELECT:** The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM users;
```

2. **WHERE:** The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

3. **INSERT INTO:** The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

4. **UPDATE:** The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
Example:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET email = 'john.doe@example.com'
WHERE id = 1;
```

5. **DELETE:** The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;
```

6. **ORDER BY:** The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY name DESC;
```

7. **JOIN:** JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. There are several types of JOIN: INNER JOIN (the default), LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.order_amount
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

8. **GROUP BY:** The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(id), country
FROM users
GROUP BY country;
```

9. **COUNT:** The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that match a specified criteria.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(id)
FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

10. **LIMIT:** The LIMIT clause is used to specify the maximum number of records to return.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```
Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 5;
```

Note: SQL syntax may vary slightly depending on the RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) you are using, such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

## Introduction to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It is known for its robustness, strong standards compliance, and extensibility. PostgreSQL supports advanced data types and performance optimizations, making it suitable for many types of applications, from personal projects to enterprise systems.

## Setting Up PostgreSQL for Use with Node.js

### Step 1: Install PostgreSQL

The first step is to install PostgreSQL on your machine. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website, and you'll find detailed installation instructions for various operating systems there.

To check all tables in a MySQL database using the MySQL Command-Line Interface (CLI), follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal application on your macOS.

2. Start the MySQL CLI by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

   ```
   mysql -u your_username -p
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your MySQL username. Enter your MySQL password when prompted.

3. After entering the password, you should be inside the MySQL CLI.

4. Switch to the desired database using the `USE` statement:

   ```
   USE your_database_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name` with the name of the database you want to check the tables for.

5. To view all tables in the current database, you can use the following command:

   ```
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

   This command will list all the tables present in the selected database.

If you want to check a specific table's structure or information, you can use the `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statements. Here's how:

1. Make sure you're already inside the MySQL CLI and connected to the desired database.

2. To view the structure of a specific table, use the `DESCRIBE` statement followed by the table name:

   ```
   DESCRIBE your_table_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_table_name` with the name of the table you want to check.

   This command will display the column names, data types, and other details of the specified table.

3. To view the complete create statement for a specific table, you can use the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement:

   ```
   SHOW CREATE TABLE your_table_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_table_name` with the name of the table you want to check.

   This command will show the complete SQL statement used to create the specified table, including all the columns, indexes, and constraints.

By using these commands, you can check all tables in a MySQL database or inspect specific tables in detail using the MySQL CLI on macOS.

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Make sure you have Node.js installed. If you haven't, you can download it from the official Node.js website. The Node Package Manager (npm) is also required and it comes bundled with the Node.js installation.

### Step 3: Create a New Node.js Application

Create a new directory for your project on your computer. Navigate into this directory in your terminal or command prompt and initialize a new Node.js application by running `npm init -y`. This command will create a new `package.json` file in your directory.

### Step 4: Install Node-Postgres (pg)

Node-Postgres is a collection of Node.js modules for interfacing with your PostgreSQL database. It supports the full feature set of PostgreSQL and makes it easy to interact with your PostgreSQL database using JavaScript. Install it using npm by running the command: `npm install pg`.

### Step 5: Setting Up Connection

Create a new file in your application directory, e.g., `db.js`. This is where you'll set up the connection to your PostgreSQL database.

Here's an example of how to set up the connection:

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your-username',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your-database',
  password: 'your-password',
  port: 5432,
});

module.exports = pool;
```

Replace `'your-username'`, `'your-password'`, and `'your-database'` with your actual PostgreSQL server details. The host is usually 'localhost' and the port is usually 5432 for local PostgreSQL installations.

You have now set up a PostgreSQL database for use with Node.js. You can import `db.js` in your other files to use the `pool` object to interact with your PostgreSQL database. Remember, each interaction should handle potential errors and should end the client (i.e., return it to the pool) when it's no longer needed.

Once you have established a connection with your PostgreSQL database, you can use Node-Postgres (pg) to perform basic CRUD operations. We'll use an example `users` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

Here's how you can perform each operation:

**1. Create (Insert)**

```javascript
const pool = require('./db');

let user = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' };
pool.query('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)', [user.name, user.email], (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log(`User added with ID: ${results.insertId}`);
});
```

**2. Read (Select)**

```javascript
pool.query('SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC', (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log(results.rows);
});
```

If you want to get a single user by ID:

```javascript
let id = 1;
pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id], (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log(results.rows);
});
```

**3. Update**

```javascript
let updatedUser = { name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane.doe@example.com', id: 1 };
pool.query(
    'UPDATE users SET name = $1, email = $2 WHERE id = $3',
    [updatedUser.name, updatedUser.email, updatedUser.id],
    (error, results) => {
        if (error) {
            throw error;
        }
        console.log(`User modified with ID: ${updatedUser.id}`);
    }
);
```

**4. Delete**

```javascript
let idToDelete = 1;
pool.query('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1', [idToDelete], (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
        throw error;
    }
    console.log(`User deleted with ID: ${idToDelete}`);
});
```

In each case, we're constructing a SQL query and passing it to `pool.query()`. We're also passing in a callback function that handles the result of the query. The callbacks follow Node.js' standard error-first callback pattern, where the first argument is an error object (which will be `null` if no error occurred), and the subsequent arguments represent data returned from the query.

Remember to handle errors properly in your application and to end the client when you're done with it. Using a pool, as done here, helps manage these client lifecycles.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. Its SQL syntax is largely standard, but it also supports some advanced features. Here are some common PostgreSQL-specific SQL queries that you might find useful.

**1. Retrieve Data (SELECT)**

Retrieve all columns from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Retrieve specific columns:

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users;
```

**2. Filtering (WHERE)**

Use conditions to filter rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

**3. Sorting (ORDER BY)**

Sort results by a column:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age DESC;
```

**4. Insert Data (INSERT INTO)**

Insert a new row into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 30);
```

**5. Update Data (UPDATE)**

Update rows in a table:

```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

**6. Delete Data (DELETE)**

Delete rows from a table:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

**7. Limit Rows (LIMIT and OFFSET)**

Retrieve a limited number of rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

Use offset to skip rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users OFFSET 10 LIMIT 10;
```

**8. Aggregate Functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN, SUM)**

Use aggregate functions to perform calculations on a set of values:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;
SELECT MAX(age) FROM users;
SELECT MIN(age) FROM users;
SELECT SUM(age) FROM users;
```

**9. Grouping (GROUP BY)**

Group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data, like count, average, etc.:

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY country;
```

**10. Joining Tables (JOIN)**

Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column:

```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.order_date
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

**11. Subqueries**

Subqueries are nested queries that provide data to the enclosing query:

```sql
SELECT name FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100);
```

**12. Date and Time Functions**

PostgreSQL has a wide range of built-in functions for working with dates and times:

```sql
SELECT NOW();
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40');
```

Remember, practicing these queries with actual data is crucial for mastering PostgreSQL.

## Introduction to MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It works on the concept of collections and documents, unlike the tables and rows found in relational databases. A single MongoDB server can contain multiple databases, where each database can contain multiple collections, and each collection can contain multiple documents.

A MongoDB document is composed of field-and-value pairs and is similar in concept to a JSON object. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents, making MongoDB particularly well suited to storing complex data types.

## Setting Up MongoDB for Use with Node.js

### Step 1: Install MongoDB

The first step is to install MongoDB on your machine. You can download it from the official MongoDB website, and you'll find detailed installation instructions for various operating systems there.

Additionally, MongoDB provides a fully-managed cloud-based version of MongoDB called MongoDB Atlas, which you can use to avoid having to host your own local instance.

### Step 2: Install Node.js

Ensure that you have Node.js installed. If you haven't, you can download it from the official Node.js website. Node Package Manager (npm) is also required, but it comes bundled with Node.js.

### Step 3: Create a New Node.js Application

Create a new directory for your project on your computer. Navigate into this directory in your terminal or command prompt and initialize a new Node.js application by running `npm init -y`. This command will create a new `package.json` file in your directory.

### Step 4: Install the MongoDB Node.js Driver

You will need the MongoDB native Node.js driver to connect to a MongoDB database from a Node.js application. You can install it using npm by running the command: `npm install mongodb`.

### Step 5: Setting Up Connection

To connect to a MongoDB database, you will use the MongoClient's `connect` function, providing it with a connection string. Here is an example of how to set up the connection:

```javascript
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const uri = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

client.connect(err => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Connected successfully to MongoDB server");
  client.close();
});
```

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB server details.

You have now set up a MongoDB database for use with Node.js. You can use the `client` object to interact with your MongoDB database. Remember, each interaction should handle potential errors and should close the client when it's no longer needed.

Once you've set up your MongoDB connection in Node.js, you can use the MongoDB native Node.js driver to perform basic CRUD operations. Here, we'll assume we are working with a database named `mydatabase` and a collection named `users`.

**1. Create (Insert)**

Insert a document into the `users` collection:

```javascript
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const uri = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/mydatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority';
const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

client.connect(err => {
  const collection = client.db("mydatabase").collection("users");
  let user = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' };
  collection.insertOne(user, function(err, res) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("User inserted");
    client.close();
  });
});
```

**2. Read (Select)**

Retrieve all documents from the `users` collection:

```javascript
client.connect(err => {
  const collection = client.db("mydatabase").collection("users");
  collection.find({}).toArray(function(err, result) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(result);
    client.close();
  });
});
```

If you want to find a single user by a specific field (like `name`):

```javascript
client.connect(err => {
  const collection = client.db("mydatabase").collection("users");
  let query = { name: 'John Doe' };
  collection.findOne(query, function(err, result) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(result);
    client.close();
  });
});
```

**3. Update**

Update a user's email in the `users` collection:

```javascript
client.connect(err => {
  const collection = client.db("mydatabase").collection("users");
  let query = { name: 'John Doe' };
  let newvalues = { $set: { email: 'john.new@example.com' } };
  collection.updateOne(query, newvalues, function(err, res) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("User updated");
    client.close();
  });
});
```

**4. Delete**

Delete a user from the `users` collection:

```javascript
client.connect(err => {
  const collection = client.db("mydatabase").collection("users");
  let query = { name: 'John Doe' };
  collection.deleteOne(query, function(err, obj) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("User deleted");
    client.close();
  });
});
```

These examples should get you started with performing CRUD operations in a MongoDB database using Node.js. Remember to replace `<username>` and `<password>` in the `uri` with your actual MongoDB server details.

Always ensure that you handle errors properly and close your MongoDB connections when they are no longer needed. Failure to do so can lead to memory leaks and other performance issues in your application.

Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.

Firstly, you'll need to install Mongoose in your project:

```bash
npm install mongoose
```

Then, you'll need to connect to your MongoDB database:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => console.log('Successfully connected to MongoDB'))
    .catch(error => console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB', error));
```

Now, let's define a schema and model for a `users` collection:

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: Number,
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

**1. Create (Insert)**

```javascript
const createUser = async () => {
    const user = new User({
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'john.doe@example.com',
        age: 30
    });

    const result = await user.save();
    console.log(result); // Output: { _id: 60cb6bbf2e799a2f447586a1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com', age: 30, __v: 0 }
};

createUser();
```

**2. Read (Select)**

Get all users:

```javascript
const getUsers = async () => {
    const users = await User.find();
    console.log(users); // Output: Array of user documents
};

getUsers();
```

Find a single user by a specific field (like `name`):

```javascript
const getUser = async () => {
    const user = await User.findOne({ name: 'John Doe' });
    console.log(user); // Output: First user document that matches the query
};

getUser();
```

**3. Update**

Update a user's email:

```javascript
const updateUser = async id => {
    const result = await User.updateOne({ _id: id }, {
        $set: {
            email: 'john.new@example.com'
        }
    });
    console.log(result); // Output: { n: 1, nModified: 1, ok: 1 } (if the user was found and updated)
};

// Assume we have a valid user id
updateUser('60cb6bbf2e799a2f447586a1');
```

**4. Delete**

Delete a user:

```javascript
const deleteUser = async id => {
    const result = await User.deleteOne({ _id: id });
    console.log(result); // Output: { n: 1, deletedCount: 1, ok: 1 } (if the user was found and deleted)
};

// Assume we have a valid user id
deleteUser('60cb6bbf2e799a2f447586a1');
```

Remember to replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017/test'` with your actual MongoDB server details. Make sure that you handle errors appropriately and disconnect from MongoDB when you're finished:

```javascript
mongoose.disconnect()
    .then(() => console.log('Disconnected from MongoDB'))
    .catch(error => console.error('Failed to disconnect from MongoDB', error));
```

Practicing these examples with actual data will be essential for mastering Mongoose and MongoDB.

<!-- https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html -->

Absolutely, Mongoose has more advanced features that are often used in real-world applications. Let's go over a few of these features: populate, virtuals, middleware, and model methods.

**1. Populate (Data Referencing)**

Mongoose's `populate` function allows you to automatically replace the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s). This is similar to joining tables in SQL.

Assume we have another schema, `Company`, and each `User` works for a `Company`:

```javascript
const companySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    location: String,
});

const Company = mongoose.model('Company', companySchema);

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: Number,
    company: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Company',
    },
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

Now we can use `populate` to retrieve users along with their company information:

```javascript
const getUsersWithCompany = async () => {
    const users = await User.find().populate('company');
    console.log(users); // Output: Array of user documents with their associated company documents
};

getUsersWithCompany();
```

**2. Virtuals**

Virtuals are document properties that you can get and set but that do not get persisted to MongoDB. For example, let's create a virtual for `fullName`:

```javascript
userSchema.virtual('fullName').get(function () {
    return `${this.name.first} ${this.name.last}`;
});
```

Now you can use `user.fullName` to get the full name of the user:

```javascript
const user = new User({
    name: { first: 'John', last: 'Doe' },
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    age: 30,
});

console.log(user.fullName); // Output: "John Doe"
```

**3. Middleware (Pre and Post Hooks)**

Mongoose middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions that are passed control during the execution of asynchronous functions. For example, let's log every time a user is saved:

```javascript
userSchema.pre('save', function (next) {
    console.log('A user is being saved:', this);
    next();
});
```

**4. Model Methods**

You can add methods to a model to handle commonly needed operations relative to the model. For example, let's add a `getAge` method:

```javascript
userSchema.methods.getAge = function () {
    return this.age;
};

const user = new User({
    name: { first: 'John', last: 'Doe' },
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    age: 30,
});

console.log(user.getAge()); // Output: 30
```

These are some of the many features offered by Mongoose. They can be extremely helpful for organizing and managing your data. Be sure to check out the [Mongoose API documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html) for more details.

## Wrap-up of the Covered Topics

In this discussion, we dove into using three different databases—MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB—with Node.js. We started with a brief introduction to databases and Node.js, understanding their importance and the role they play in application development.

For each database, we went through the steps of setting up the database for use in Node.js and demonstrated how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, including code snippets.

For MongoDB, we went a step further and explored using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool that provides a schema-based solution to model data. It offers several features such as data referencing (`populate`), virtuals, middleware (pre and post hooks), and model methods.

## Comparison and When to Use Each of These Databases

### MySQL and PostgreSQL (Relational Databases)

MySQL and PostgreSQL are both powerful, open-source relational database management systems. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing and manipulating the data. They are excellent choices when your data is structured and complex, and when integrity is essential. These databases are great for applications that require multi-row transactions like banking systems or any system where you need to ensure that your data is consistent and ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

MySQL and PostgreSQL are databases that organize data in a structured way, like a table with rows and columns. This is great when your data is complex and needs to be very accurate. For example, in a banking system, you want to make sure all transactions are handled correctly, so MySQL or PostgreSQL would be good choices.

Comparatively, MySQL is known for its ease of use and speed, while PostgreSQL is known for its standards compliance and flexibility. PostgreSQL supports some advanced features such as arrays and JSON fields. 

MySQL is easy to use and fast, while PostgreSQL has more advanced features.

### MongoDB (NoSQL Database)

MongoDB, on the other hand, is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. It's a good fit for real-time analytics, content management systems, IoT applications, and for any place where you may need to store multilevel nested data. MongoDB can be highly advantageous in terms of horizontal scaling and speed when dealing with large amounts of data.

MongoDB is different from MySQL and PostgreSQL. It stores data in a flexible, "document" format, which is like storing data in a way that's similar to how we write and use JSON. This is really useful for dealing with large amounts of data that don't have a fixed structure.

For example, if you're building a system to analyze tweets in real-time, MongoDB would be a great choice because it's fast and can handle lots of different types of data.

### Horizontal Scaling

When we say a database can "horizontally scale," it means that to handle more data or traffic, we can just add more machines or servers to our system. MongoDB is good at this. If you're working with a very large amount of data or users, this is an important factor.

### Picking the Right Database

The right database for you depends on your app's needs. Before you choose a database, think about what kind of data you'll be storing, how fast your app needs to be, and how your data will grow in the future. Sometimes, it might even make sense to use more than one type of database for different parts of your app. This idea is called "polyglot persistence."

### Conclusion

The choice between MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB depends on the specific requirements of your application. You need to consider the data structure, speed requirements, scaling, and the complexity of transactions you are dealing with. A good practice is to analyze your project requirements thoroughly and choose the database technology that fits best with those needs. Sometimes, using a combination of different types of databases, a concept known as polyglot persistence, might be the optimal solution.

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE myDatabase;
USE myDatabase;
CREATE TABLE myTable (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
INSERT INTO myTable (name) VALUES ('test');
```

- **How to use MySQL with Node.js**: Install the `mysql` library with npm: `npm install mysql`. Then you can use it in your application:

const mysql = require('mysql');
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host     : 'localhost',
  user     : 'root',
  password : 'password',
  database : 'myDatabase'
});

connection.connect();

connection.query('SELECT * FROM myTable', function (error, results, fields) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(results);
});

connection.end();
```

## PostgreSQL

- **PostgreSQL installation guide**: Download PostgreSQL from the official website, or use Homebrew on macOS: `brew install postgresql`.

- **How to set up a PostgreSQL server**: Start the PostgreSQL server with `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`.

- **Basic operations in PostgreSQL**: Creating a database, a table, and inserting data in PostgreSQL is similar to MySQL:
```SQL

  user     : 'root',
  password : 'password',
  database : 'myDatabase'
});

client.connect();

client.query('SELECT * FROM myTable', (err, res) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(res.rows);

  client.end();
});
```

## MongoDB

- **MongoDB installation guide**: Download MongoDB from the official website, or use Homebrew on macOS: `brew install mongodb`.

- **How to set up a MongoDB server**: Start the MongoDB server with `brew services start mongodb`.

- **Basic operations in MongoDB**: MongoDB uses a shell that's similar to JavaScript. Here's an example of creating a database, a collection, and inserting a document:
```javascript
use myDatabase
db.createCollection('myCollection')
db.myCollection.insert({name: 'test'})
```

- **How to use MongoDB with Node.js**: Install the `mongodb` library with npm: `npm install mongodb`. Here's how you use it in your application:

client.connect(function(err) {
  const db = client.db('myDatabase');
  const collection = db.collection('myCollection');
  collection.find({}).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    console.log(docs);
    client.close();
  });
});
```

## Prisma

- **Prisma setup**: Install the Prisma CLI globally with npm: `npm install -g pr

isma`. Then initialize Prisma in your project: `prisma init`.

- **Using Prisma with Node.js and PostgreSQL/MySQL**: In the Prisma schema file (usually `schema.prisma`), define your database connection and schema:
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://root:password@localhost:5432/myDatabase"
}

model MyTable {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
}
```
Then generate the Prisma Client: `npx prisma generate`.

- **Examples of CRUD operations with Prisma**: Use the Prisma Client in your application like this:
```javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const allData = await prisma.myTable.findMany()
  console.log(allData)
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```
This example retrieves and prints all rows from `MyTable`. Other operations like `create`, `update`, and `delete` are done in a similar way.

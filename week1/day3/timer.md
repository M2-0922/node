In JavaScript, setImmediate, setInterval, and setTimeout are functions that allow you to schedule the execution of code at specific intervals or after a certain delay. Here's an explanation of each function along with coding examples:

`setImmediate`:

The setImmediate function schedules the execution of a function on the next iteration of the event loop.
It is commonly used when you want to execute a function asynchronously but without delaying it until the next tick of the event loop.
Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('setImmediate callback');
});

console.log('End');
```

`Output`:

```js
Start
End
setImmediate callback
```

`setInterval`:

The setInterval function repeatedly executes a function at a specified interval, measured in milliseconds.
It continues executing until stopped using clearInterval.
Here's an example that logs a message every 1 second:

```javascript
let counter = 0;

const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Interval:', counter);
  counter++;

  if (counter === 5) {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    console.log('Interval stopped');
  }
}, 1000);
```

`Output`:

```js
Interval: 0
Interval: 1
Interval: 2
Interval: 3
Interval: 4
Interval stopped
```

`setTimeout`:

The setTimeout function schedules the execution of a function after a specified delay, measured in milliseconds.
It executes the function once and does not repeat like setInterval.
Here's an example that displays a message after a delay of 2 seconds:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 2000);

console.log('End');
```

`Output`:

```js
Start
End
Timeout callback
```

In summary, setImmediate schedules the execution of a function on the next iteration of the event loop, setInterval repeatedly executes a function at a specified interval until stopped, and setTimeout executes a function once after a specified delay. These functions are useful for asynchronous programming, scheduling tasks, and managing timing-related operations in JavaScript.

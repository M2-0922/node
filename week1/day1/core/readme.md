### How client and server works: 

- `Client:` The client is the application that runs on the user's computer. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the server to fetch data and perform other operations.

- `Server:` The server is the application that runs on the server-side. It is responsible for handling incoming requests and sending responses. It communicates with the client to send data and perform other operations.

- `Client-Server Communication:` The client and server communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol. The client sends requests to the server, and the server sends responses back to the client. The client can make requests to the server using different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

- `Client-Side Rendering (CSR):` In client-side rendering, the initial HTML is generated on the client-side. The client-side JavaScript bundle is responsible for rendering the page, fetching data, and handling user interactions. The client-side JavaScript bundle is sent to the client, which takes over control of the page on the client-side.

- `Server-Side Rendering (SSR):` In server-side rendering, the initial HTML is generated on the server-side. The server-side rendering function is responsible for rendering the page, fetching data, and handling user interactions. The initial HTML is sent to the client, along with the client-side JavaScript bundle, which takes over control of the page on the client-side.

`ipconfig getifaddr en0`: Get your local ip address
`npm install -g localtunnel`: Install localtunnel
`lt --port 3000`: Run localtunnel on port 3000
`lt --port 3000 --subdomain my-app`: Run localtunnel on port 3000 with subdomain my-app



### HTTP:
The http module provides functionality to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests. It allows you to handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses. Here's an example of creating an HTTP server:
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

`Code lab question:` Implement an HTTP server that responds with a JSON object when a GET request is made to the endpoint '/users'.

### Path:
The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It can be used to manipulate file paths, extract file extensions, normalize paths, and more. Here's an example:
```javascript
const path = require('path');

const filePath = '/home/user/documents/file.txt';

console.log(path.basename(filePath)); // Output: file.txt
console.log(path.dirname(filePath)); // Output: /home/user/documents
console.log(path.extname(filePath)); // Output: .txt
```

`Code lab question:` Write a function that takes a file path as input and returns the file extension.

### FS:
The fs module provides file system-related functionality for both reading from and writing to files. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete files and directories. Here's an example:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'Hello, World!', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File created and written successfully!');
});

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File content:', data);
});
```

`Code lab question:` Implement a function that reads a file, counts the number of occurrences of a specific word, and returns the count.

### UTIL:
The util module provides various utility functions that are helpful for debugging, formatting, and working with objects. It offers functions for inheritance, error handling, and more. Here's an example:
```javascript
const util = require('util');

const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};

console.log(util.inspect(obj)); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30 }
console.log(util.format('Hello, %s!', obj.name)); // Output: Hello, John!
```

`Code lab question:` Write a function that checks if a given value is an object and returns a boolean value accordingly.

### QUERYSTRING:
The querystring module provides utilities for working with query strings. It allows you to parse query strings into objects and convert objects into query strings. Here's an example:
```javascript
const querystring = require('querystring');

const params = querystring.parse('name=John&age=30');
console.log(params); // Output: { name: 'John', age: '30' }

const queryString = querystring.stringify(params);
console.log(queryString); // Output: name=John&age=30
```

`Code lab question:` Implement a function that takes an object and returns a query string representation of its properties.

};

const queryString = objectToQueryString(obj);

### `package.json` and `node_modules`:

`package.json` is a file used in Node.js projects to define metadata and configuration for the project. It includes information about the project, its dependencies, scripts, and more. It acts as a manifest for the project.
The `node_modules` directory is a default directory created when you install dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). It contains all the dependencies required by the project, each in its own separate directory.

The `package.json` file specifies the dependencies of the project, including their versions, and when you run `npm install`, npm reads the package.json file and installs the required dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.

### Import and Export:

import and export are syntaxes introduced in the ECMAScript (ES) modules system, which is a standard for organizing and sharing JavaScript code across different files or modules.
The import statement is used to import functions, objects, or values from other modules into the current module. It allows you to use the exported entities from other modules in your code.

The export statement is used to export functions, objects, or values from a module, making them available for use in other modules. It allows you to expose specific entities from a module to be used externally.

Here's an example of import and export in action:

```js
// math.js (module 1)
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// main.js (module 2)
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(10, 4)); // Output: 6
```

In the example above, we have two modules: math.js and main.js. The math.js module exports the add and subtract functions using the export statement. In the main.js module, we use the import statement to import the add and subtract functions from math.js and use them in our code.

Note that the import and export statements are part of the ES modules system and are supported in modern browsers and recent versions of Node.js. If you are working with an older version of Node.js or using CommonJS modules, you would typically use require() and module.exports for importing and exporting modules.

Dynamic content refers to the ability to generate and display different content based on various factors, such as user input, data from a database, or external APIs. Templating is a technique used to generate dynamic content by combining static HTML templates with dynamic data. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a popular templating language for Node.js that allows you to embed JavaScript code within HTML templates to generate dynamic content. Let's dive deeper into each topic:

Templating:
Templating involves creating reusable HTML templates with placeholders or tags that will be dynamically replaced with actual data during runtime. This approach separates the presentation layer (HTML) from the logic layer (JavaScript). Templating engines provide syntax and features to inject dynamic data into the templates.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript):
EJS is a templating language that allows you to embed JavaScript code directly within HTML templates. It provides a straightforward syntax for inserting dynamic values, running loops, conditionals, and executing JavaScript functions within the template. EJS templates have a .ejs file extension and are compiled into HTML at runtime.

Example of EJS template (template.ejs):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Dynamic Content Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome, <%= user.name %>!</h1>
  <% if (user.isAdmin) { %>
    <p>You have administrative privileges.</p>
  <% } else { %>
    <p>You have regular user privileges.</p>
  <% } %>
</body>
</html>
```
Example usage of EJS template in Node.js:

```js
const ejs = require('ejs');
const fs = require('fs');

const template = fs.readFileSync('template.ejs', 'utf8');
const user = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  isAdmin: true,
};
const renderedTemplate = ejs.render(template, { user });

console.log(renderedTemplate);
```

In the above example, we read the template.ejs file, which contains an EJS template. We define a user object with dynamic data. By calling ejs.render(), we pass the template and the data object to generate the final HTML output. The resulting HTML is stored in renderedTemplate and can be used further, such as sending it as a response in an HTTP server.

EJS supports a range of features, including template inheritance, partials, passing variables, and custom functions. It allows you to create highly dynamic and customizable HTML output based on the provided data.

### Asynchronicity and Event Loops:
Asynchronicity is a programming paradigm that allows multiple operations to be executed concurrently without blocking the execution of the program. Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous operations efficiently using an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. The event loop is a critical component of Node.js that manages and dispatches events, ensuring that asynchronous operations are executed efficiently.

### Node.js File System Module:
The fs module in Node.js provides functionality to work with the file system. It allows you to perform various operations such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting files, working with directories, and more. The fs module provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for file system operations.

### Node.js URL Module:
The url module in Node.js provides utilities for URL parsing and manipulation. It allows you to parse URL strings into components (such as protocol, host, path, query parameters, etc.), format URL components into a complete URL, resolve relative URLs, and more. The url module is commonly used when working with HTTP requests and routing in web applications.

### Callbacks Recap:
Callbacks are a fundamental concept in asynchronous programming in Node.js. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed once an asynchronous operation completes. Callbacks allow you to handle the result or error of an asynchronous operation and continue with the program's execution.

### Promise Recap:
Promises provide an alternative approach to handling asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way. Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together. Promises provide methods such as then() and catch() to handle the success and error cases, respectively.

### Express.js Basics:
Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications by providing a set of features and tools. Express.js helps with handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware integration, and more.

### Creating Express Server:
To create an Express server, you need to install the Express module and then set up routes and middleware. Here's a basic example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

In the above example, we create an Express app, define a route for the root URL (/), and send a response with the message "Hello, World!" when the root URL is accessed. The server listens on port 3000.

### Middlewares:
Middleware functions in Express are functions that have access to the request and response objects and can perform operations on them. They can be used to modify the request or response, perform authentication, log requests, handle errors, and more. Middleware functions can be registered globally or for specific routes.

### Handling Requests: Routing:
Routing in Express involves mapping incoming requests to specific handlers based on the request method and URL. Express provides routing methods for different HTTP methods (get(), post(), put(), delete(), etc.) that allow you to define routes and their corresponding handler functions.

### Handling Responses: Templating:
Template engines in Express allow you to dynamically generate HTML or other markup by combining templates with data. Express supports various template engines like EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, and more. Templating engines enable you to render dynamic content and generate HTML responses to be sent back to the client.

### The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used in web applications, including those built with Express.js. The MVC pattern helps in structuring the application by separating concerns into three main components:
Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: Handles the presentation and rendering of the data to the user.
Controller: Receives requests, processes them, and interacts with the model and view accordingly.
By following the MVC pattern, you can maintain a separation of concerns and improve the maintainability and scalability of your application.

### Advanced Routing and Controllers:
In Express.js, you can define more complex routing patterns using route parameters and regular expressions. Route parameters allow you to extract dynamic values from the URL, which can be used to customize the behavior of your application. Controllers are modules or functions that handle the business logic for specific routes or groups of routes. Controllers help in keeping the route handling logic separate from the route definitions and provide a modular and reusable approach.

Here's an example of advanced routing and controller usage:

```js
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Routes
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

// Mounting routes
app.use('/users', userRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

// routes/userRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const userController = require('../controllers/userController');

// GET /users
router.get('/', userController.getAllUsers);

// POST /users
router.post('/', userController.createUser);

// GET /users/:id
router.get('/:id', userController.getUserById);

module.exports = router;

// controllers/userController.js
const getAllUsers = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to fetch all users from the model
  // Return the response
};

const createUser = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to create a new user based on the request body
  // Return the response
};

const getUserById = (req, res) => {
  // Extract the user ID from route parameters (req.params.id)
  // Logic to fetch the user by ID from the model
  // Return the response
};

module.exports = {
  getAllUsers,
  createUser,
  getUserById,
};
```

In the above example, we have separate files for defining routes (userRoutes.js) and handling route logic `(userController.js)`. The controller functions (getAllUsers, createUser, getUserById) contain the actual logic for handling the requests and generating the responses.

By organizing the code in this way, we can achieve a modular structure and separate concerns between routing and the associated logic.

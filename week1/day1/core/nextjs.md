`Next.js` is a popular framework for building React applications, and it provides server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities out of the box. When you run a Next.js application, it can be configured to handle server-side rendering, which means that the initial HTML is generated on the server and then sent to the client.

Here's a high-level overview of how Next.js can run on the server side:

- `Server Configuration:` Next.js applications are typically run using Node.js. You set up a server to handle incoming requests and responses. This server is responsible for rendering the initial HTML of your Next.js application.

- `Page Rendering:` Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Each page in your Next.js application corresponds to a file in the pages directory. When a request is made to a specific URL, Next.js determines the corresponding page file and invokes the associated server-side rendering function.

- `Server-Side Rendering:` In the server-side rendering function, you can fetch data from external APIs, query a database, or perform any other server-side operations. This data is then used to render the page on the server, generating the initial HTML content.

- `Client-Side Hydration:` Once the server-side rendering is complete, the initial HTML is sent to the client. The client-side JavaScript bundle is also included, which takes over control of the page on the client-side. The JavaScript bundle is responsible for rehydrating the page, attaching event handlers, and making the application interactive.

- `Client-Side Navigation:` After the initial page load, subsequent navigation within the Next.js application is handled on the client-side. When the user clicks on a link or interacts with the application, Next.js uses client-side rendering (CSR) to update the content without a full page reload.

By combining server-side rendering with client-side rendering, Next.js provides the benefits of both approaches. It enables faster initial page loads, improves search engine optimization (SEO), and provides a smooth client-side navigation experience.

A refresh token is a concept commonly used in authentication systems, particularly in the context of token-based authentication. It is an additional token that is issued alongside an access token. 

The main purpose of a refresh token is to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthenticate with their credentials, such as username and password, on every request. Refresh tokens are typically long-lived, meaning they have a longer expiration time compared to access tokens.

Here are a few reasons why using refresh tokens can be beneficial in an authentication system:

1. **Enhanced Security:** Refresh tokens provide an added layer of security. Since they have a longer expiration time and are used less frequently than access tokens, the potential window for unauthorized access or token misuse is reduced. If an access token is compromised, its shorter lifespan mitigates the impact.

2. **Improved User Experience:** Using refresh tokens allows for a smoother user experience. By providing a refresh token, users can obtain a new access token seamlessly without having to re-enter their credentials or go through the authentication process again. This is particularly useful for long-lived sessions or when access tokens expire frequently.

3. **Reduced Server Load:** With refresh tokens, the server can offload some of the authentication tasks, reducing the need to validate credentials and generate new access tokens on every request. This can result in improved performance and reduced server load, especially in systems with high user concurrency.

4. **Revocation and Control:** Refresh tokens can be revoked independently of access tokens. This provides more control and flexibility in managing user sessions. If a user's device is lost, stolen, or compromised, their refresh token can be invalidated without affecting their access token. This enhances security and allows for more granular control over user sessions.

It's important to note that the usage of refresh tokens introduces additional complexity to the authentication system. Proper security measures, such as securely storing and transmitting tokens, token revocation mechanisms, and token rotation policies, should be implemented to ensure the overall security of the system.

By utilizing refresh tokens in conjunction with access tokens, authentication systems can strike a balance between security and usability, providing a seamless and secure user experience while reducing the overhead of frequent reauthentication.

Here's an example of implementing refresh token logic in a Node.js and Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Secret key used for signing and verifying tokens
const secretKey = 'your-secret-key';

// In-memory storage for refresh tokens (in production, use a secure database)
const refreshTokens = [];

// Route for user authentication and issuing access and refresh tokens
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  // Perform authentication and verify user credentials
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  // Check if the username and password are valid
  if (username === 'example' && password === 'password') {
    // Generate an access token with a short lifespan
    const accessToken = jwt.sign({ username }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '30s' });

    // Generate a refresh token with a longer lifespan
    const refreshToken = jwt.sign({ username }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1d' });

    // Store the refresh token in the server's memory or database
    refreshTokens.push(refreshToken);

    // Return the access token and refresh token to the client
    res.json({ accessToken, refreshToken });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }
});

// Route for refreshing access tokens
app.post('/refresh', (req, res) => {
  const { refreshToken } = req.body;

  // Check if the refresh token is valid and exists in the server's memory or database
  if (!refreshToken || !refreshTokens.includes(refreshToken)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid refresh token' });
  }

  // Verify the refresh token and extract the username
  jwt.verify(refreshToken, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Failed to verify refresh token' });
    }

    const { username } = decoded;

    // Generate a new access token with a short lifespan
    const accessToken = jwt.sign({ username }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '30s' });

    // Return the new access token to the client
    res.json({ accessToken });
  });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this example, we have two routes: `/login` for user authentication and issuing access and refresh tokens, and `/refresh` for refreshing access tokens using a valid refresh token.

When a user successfully authenticates using their username and password, the server generates an access token with a short lifespan (30 seconds in this example) and a refresh token with a longer lifespan (1 day in this example). The refresh token is stored in the server's memory (or database in a production environment) for later validation.

To refresh the access token, the client sends a request to the `/refresh` endpoint with the refresh token. The server verifies the refresh token, extracts the username, and generates a new access token. The new access token is then returned to the client.

It's important to secure the communication between the client and server by using HTTPS and storing the refresh tokens securely. Additionally, consider implementing mechanisms to handle token revocation and expiration, such as token blacklisting or token rotation policies, based on your specific requirements and security considerations.

Note: This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you may want to enhance the code with additional security measures and error handling.

In JWT (JSON Web Token) logic, a refresh token is used in conjunction with an access token to maintain the user session's continuity without requiring the user to frequently reauthenticate.

The main reasons to use a refresh token are:

1. **Limited Access Token Lifespan:** Access tokens have a short expiry time, often on the order of minutes or hours. When the access token expires, instead of prompting the user to log in again, a refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token.

2. **Security:** By keeping the access token's lifespan short, the potential damage can be minimized in case it is stolen. Even if an attacker gets an access token, they can only use it for a short period. A refresh token is usually stored securely on the server and is not exposed to the client side, reducing the risk.

3. **Revocation:** Refresh tokens can be revoked without affecting the user's session. If a user's refresh token is suspected to be compromised, it can be revoked and a new one issued. Meanwhile, the access token will continue to work until its short lifespan expires.

As for where to store refresh tokens, both a relational database and Redis can be used, but they have different strengths.

1. **Database:** If you use a database to store refresh tokens, you can take advantage of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Also, it becomes easier to track and manage refresh tokens on a per-user basis.

2. **Redis:** Redis, being an in-memory data structure store, offers faster read/write operations compared to traditional databases. This can be advantageous if you have a large number of users and need to manage many refresh tokens concurrently. Additionally, Redis's data structures are highly flexible and can easily expire keys (tokens), which aligns well with the concept of refresh tokens.

It ultimately depends on your specific use case and requirements. If your application is read-heavy and you need fast operations, Redis might be a better choice. If, on the other hand, you want more complex query capabilities and long-term persistence, a relational database might be more appropriate.

Sure, let's start by setting up the structure of the application. Below is a simplified file and folder structure for a MERN application with JWT authentication and refresh tokens:

```
/myapp
  /client
    /src
      /actions
        authActions.js
      /reducers
        authReducer.js
      /components
        App.js
      index.js
    package.json
  /server
    /models
      User.js
    /routes
      authRoutes.js
    /middleware
      authenticateToken.js
    app.js
    package.json
```

Here is a simplified explanation of how the files will work:

1. **User.js:** This is a Mongoose model for users. It should define a schema for users and store user-specific information.

2. **authRoutes.js:** This file contains your authentication routes such as login, register, refreshToken, and logout. 

3. **authenticateToken.js:** This is a middleware function for protected routes. It verifies the access token and proceeds if valid. If invalid, it returns an error response. 

4. **authActions.js and authReducer.js:** These are Redux actions and reducers for authentication. They help manage authentication state (like whether the user is logged in and the user's info) and actions (like login and logout) on the client side.

5. **App.js:** This is your main React component that uses your Redux actions and state.

Now, let's discuss handling tokens in this application:

**Server Side**

In `authRoutes.js`, when a user logs in or signs up, generate an access token and a refresh token. The access token is sent back to the client in the response body, and the refresh token is stored in the database and sent as a HTTP-only cookie.

```javascript
router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  // Authentication logic here...
  
  // Create tokens
  const accessToken = jwt.sign(user.toJSON(), process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
  const refreshToken = jwt.sign(user.toJSON(), process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '14d' });

  // Save refresh token in the database
  user.refreshToken = refreshToken;
  await user.save();

  // Send tokens
  res
    .cookie('refreshToken', refreshToken, { httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'strict', secure: true })
    .json({ accessToken });
});
```

Create a route to generate a new access token if the provided one is expired or invalid.

```javascript
router.post('/refreshToken', (req, res) => {
  const refreshToken = req.cookies.refreshToken;
  
  // If there is no token in the request
  if (!refreshToken) return res.sendStatus(401);
  
  // If the refresh token exists, verify it
  jwt.verify(refreshToken, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, async (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    
    // Find the user in the database and check the stored refresh token
    const dbUser = await User.findById(user._id);
    if (!dbUser || dbUser.refreshToken !== refreshToken) return res.sendStatus(403);

    // If everything is okay, create new tokens and send them
    const newAccessToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
    const newRefreshToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: '14d' });

    // Save new refresh token in the database
    dbUser.refreshToken = newRefreshToken;
    await dbUser.save();

    // Send new tokens
    res
      .cookie('refreshToken

', newRefreshToken, { httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'strict', secure: true })
      .json({ accessToken: newAccessToken });
  });
});
```

**Client Side**

In `authActions.js`, define actions for logging in and refreshing the token.

```javascript
export const login = (username, password) => async (dispatch) => {
  const res = await axios.post('/api/login', { username, password });
  
  // Save access token in Redux state
  dispatch({
    type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS',
    payload: res.data.accessToken
  });
};

export const refreshToken = () => async (dispatch) => {
  const res = await axios.post('/api/refreshToken');
  
  // Save new access token in Redux state
  dispatch({
    type: 'REFRESH_TOKEN',
    payload: res.data.accessToken
  });
};
```

In your `App.js` component, call the refreshToken action whenever an API call fails due to an invalid or expired token. Then, with the new token, retry the failed request.

```javascript
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { refreshToken } from './actions/authActions';

// ...

const App = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const accessToken = useSelector((state) => state.auth.accessToken);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const res = await axios.get('/api/data', {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
      });
      // Handle data...
    } catch (err) {
      if (err.response.status === 403 || err.response.status === 401) {
        dispatch(refreshToken());
        // Retry the failed request...
      }
      // Handle other errors...
    }
  };

  // ...
};
```
